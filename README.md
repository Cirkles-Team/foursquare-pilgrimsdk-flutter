# Pilgrim SDK for Flutter
This is a Flutter plugin for the Foursquare Pilgrim SDK.

## Getting Started
Import this git as a dependency in `pubspec.yaml` of your Flutter project.

```yaml
dependencies:
  foursquare_pilgrimsdk:
    git: git://github.com/matthewhuie/foursquare-pilgrimsdk-flutter.git
```

You'll need your JFrog Artifactory and Foursquare API credentials for both Android and iOS libraries.
